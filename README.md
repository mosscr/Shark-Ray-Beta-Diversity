# Shark-Ray-Beta-Diversity

The objective of this project is to measure beta diversity using a distance-decay model, based on the Buckley and Jetz paper 

You will have to download the comm and coords data and run the vegan library to use the code. There are explanations in the code for each process, but once you have downloaded the data and vegan, the code should run with no issues. The only note that I would like to point out is that different figures use different linear models, both listed as 'mod' and you will have to switch between them to correctly display the figures. The linear model used is noted under each figure, so if the abline doesn't run correctly, check the model you are using.

Thank you to Dr. McGlinn for providing me with the data!
